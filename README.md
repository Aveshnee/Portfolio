## AVESHNEE IYER RESUME

I am enthusiastic about innovation as an enabler to social sustainability & economic growth in South Africa. I have studied my masters in innovation, AI engineering and data science with machine learning using python. Worked across the value chain for many years in various roles and understand different domains and ecosystems.

Engaged and worked daily with customers and vendors, development teams in building strategies from start, shifting into execution (via technical roadmaps). Extensive SME, Business and Commercial Banking knowledge. I have gained extensive experience and expertise in product management and development, IT project and program management, as well as Commercial Segment Management.

Excited to be adding machine learning with python and data EDA and visualisation to my proposition building while conducting Proof of concept's.
